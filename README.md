This is a simple [Tomato6966/erela.js](https://github.com/Tomato6966/erela.js) example music bot.

Please edit the `config.json` file first. (Add Token Bot, Prefix, and Owner Bot ID, Spotify clientID, Spotify clientSecret)

## Requirement

- [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) v14
